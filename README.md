Simple mobile client for Hospital Scanner project. It allowes user to login and scan QR codes with patients IDs. App shows medical records provided by [a server](https://github.com/ciuek/HospitalScannerServer).

TODO:
- Scanning QR codes without login, to show basic patient information such as blood type or allergies (for instant help),
- Posibility to modify medical records from the app,
- Better design.
